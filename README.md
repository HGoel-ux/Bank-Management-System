# Bank-Management-System
This is a simple Bank Management System created using C++. It implements various OOPS features, file handling, and other features provided by C++ Language.

OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
The objective is to create application software which cans mange all about the customers currently working in bank in order relative them from their manual accounting system.
The various reasons which led to the conversion of the manual system of the bank to the computerized system are as follows:-
1.Entry of information in various registers was a very hectic job for the customer.
2.The entry of information causing error in entering details of customer.  
3.Even the redundancy of the record was also found through they had taken certain precautions like entering the information with thepencil, leaving the space for making the entry in future, if not possibly confirmed about the details.
4.The error prone details causing the making in the other related registers, which might some problem while producing reports.
5.Even a lot of times begin spent on the entering of details after crosschecking details from various registers.
6.Then the security of these registers being a major problem. Even a single page should not be missing. Then, it should not get into the hand of some unauthorized person.
7.And last but not least, because it is very calculation oriented and computerized system can be used for given current result always.The proposed Bank Account system will make current manual system easy to monitor, efficient and almost error free.
 
INTRODUCTION
Bank account system involves maintaining of account related information.This requires grater accuracy, speed that is why the proposed system is the computerization of the existing system. The computerization system does the job monitoring the record in easy and effective manner as stated below:
1.Efficiently handles customer's account related data.
2.Monitor transaction and makes related information.
3.Keeps records of customer account detail and other information.
4.Generates reports. Account system involved maintaining data related different customer and his transaction. This required greater accuracy, speed that is why the proposedsystem is the computerization of the existing system. The computerized system does the job of the monitoring the information easy and effective manner..
  
 
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING SYSTEM 
In the ongoing process, the records are maintained manually and the paperwork is more.
1. Entering Record- Entry of each record is done manually each time the record is doneManually .Each time the record is maintained on paper and it maximizes themaintenance of additional files.
2. Searching the record- Due to absence of unique identification of person the searching of recordtakes much time. And in the wastage of time increase.
3. Deleting the Record- In the current system there is no concept of deleting record.
4. Modification of Records- If any modification is required it is done directly on the documents being preserved in correspondence to account information.
5. Sorting of Records- All the record of Account is maintained on papers. And if in any case wewant to see any particular record we have to search a lot of pages.

PROBLEMS
1.As the work is carried out manually so the requirement of themaintenance of record.
2.The system is handled manually so it requires a lot of time to maintain the records.
3.The current system is not reliable as manually recording often leads to mistakes and no accurate result are found.
4.No feasibility
5.As huge data is to be maintaining, so it’s not easy to maintain thehuge data without any error, which in turn makes the less efficient.
 
DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED SYSTEM 
To avoid the limitation of current system it’s necessary to design anddevelop a new system which have the following benefit and the existing system.
(a)Everything is automated which reduce the risk factor.
(b)Flexibility in generating of information.
(c)Quick retrieved and maintenance of data.
(d)Highly accurate.
(e)User satisfaction
